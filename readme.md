## 💡Concept
This is a repository for my project thath I'm working on for school. I'm focussing on making a **feature**  that matches the preferences from the user to a pet that's up for adoption. With the aid of front-end and back-end I'm making this happen. For further information I suggest you check out my [Wiki!](https://github.com/lucaoudejans/projecttech/wiki)
